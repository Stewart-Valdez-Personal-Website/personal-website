# personal-website
Personal Website designed to be my Software Engineering portfolio.
The start of this portfolio will be a brief description of my background.
The idea of this portfolio is to add some style while keeping it simple.
Some information and ideas are inspired from digging into W3 Schools and MDN.
Used lorem for a text placeholder.
